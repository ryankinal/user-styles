Some parts of the web are, really, a mess. The content might be something worth looking at, but the interface and/or design is just terrible (or maybe just not exactly what I want *:cough:*GoogleReader*:cough:*.

So, I change it. Using the Stylish plugin for Chrome.

And here's where I'll store my styles.

**A quick note on !important**

It's bad practice. It really is. But due to the way user styles are implemented with Stylish, it's sometimes necessary (or just far easier) to use `!important`

**Latest:**

Google Reader is being killed off. So I've started using Feedly, and have been customizing it.
